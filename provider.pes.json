He took the time to explain the injury, surgery and post-surgery information so there were no surprises. ",

He is a gifted surgeon and had our complete confidence. We were not disappointed even though it is scary surgery with a one year recuperation. The results are amazing! Also, he and his staff could not be easier to deal with, he fully explains everything, and he takes as much time as we need at all appointments. He is warm, encouraging and personable. I highly recommend Dr. Oh. ",
